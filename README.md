## Story Structure

### Prologue
The opening sets the tone - a cynical, washed-up hero watching the gleaming superhero Aegis on TV while contemplating the nature of modern heroism and the mysterious villain "Smile."

### Character Creation
Define who you were:
- Your hero name
- Your companion's name  
- Your martial art discipline (Krav Maga, Jeet Kune Do, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or Muay Thai)

### Chapter 1: The Call
**Part 1: Evening Choices**
Make small choices about how you spend your evening, then face a critical decision when Maya texts you about a bank robbery in progress. Will you:
- **Go to the Bank** - Suit up and return to action (story continues)
- **Stay Here** - Choose inaction and face the consequences (ending)

**Part 2: Bank Robbery**
If you choose action, arrive at First People's Bank where two brute-class metahumans (Crusher and Boulder) are terrorizing civilians.

*Phase A: Tactical Entry*
Choose your approach (each plays out differently based on your martial art):
- **Direct Approach** - Create a distraction and breach from the side
- **Unconventional Entry** - Find an unexpected way in
- **Patient Takedown** - Isolate and eliminate one target silently
- **Psychological Play** - Attack their minds before their bodies

*Result: 16 unique entry scenarios (4 approaches × 4 martial arts)*

*Phase B: Turn-Based Combat*
Fight Crusher in a 4-turn tactical combat sequence:
- **Turn 1**: Inside his guard - Target leg or close distance
- **Turn 2**: Reckless assault - Use environment or weaponize debris
- **Turn 3**: Wounded animal - Dirty tactic or aggressive counter
- **Turn 4**: The finish - Kill him or force surrender

*Result: 16 possible combat sequences × 2 endings = 32 combat variations*

**Part 3: Aftermath & Maya's Call**
After the fight, escape and receive a call from Maya. Engage in a 3-turn philosophical conversation:
- **Turn 1**: How do you feel about the violence? (3 perspectives)
- **Turn 2**: What does Smile's strategy tell you? (3 interpretations)
- **Turn 3**: Will you continue or walk away? (3 choices, 1 leads to ending)

*Result: 27 possible conversation paths × 3 outcomes (2 continue, 1 ends)*

### Chapter 2: The League of Extraordinary Disappointments
Meet your team of misfits at the headquarters above a Vietnamese restaurant. Maya introduces you to four heroes with seemingly useless powers:
- **Chronos** - Always knows the exact time (but can't time travel)
- **Aura** - Makes objects glow softly in pastel colors  
- **Polyglot** - Speaks dead languages fluently
- **Decibel** - Replicates sounds at conversational volume

**Your Mission**: Talk to all 4 team members and reframe their "useless" powers as strategic assets.

*Each team member has 3 different strategic applications you can propose*
- Must interact with all 4 before proceeding
- Visual tracking shows who you've talked to (✓)
- Builds a complete team before the warehouse mission

*Result: 3^4 = 81 possible team upgrade combinations*
